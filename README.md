# GANs-VAEs



Implemented and compared two Generative AI techniques — GANs and VAEs — for anomaly detection on MNIST Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

✅ Built GANs to generate synthetic images of digits and fashion items (e.g., shoes)
✅ Trained VAEs to reconstruct inputs and identify anomalies based on reconstruction error
✅ Achieved 0.93 ROC-AUC using VAE for anomaly detection
✅ Visualized latent space using PCA/t-SNE for interpretability
✅ Compared models in terms of image quality, training stability, and latent space structure
✅ Explored real-world applications in fraud detection, cybersecurity, and predictive maintenance

Both models served distinct goals:
• GANs produced sharper images but required careful tuning
• VAEs offered more structured latent representations, ideal for anomaly detection
